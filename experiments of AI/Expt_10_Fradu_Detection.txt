DESIGN FRAUD DETECTION ALGORITHM  
 
 
Aim: To design a fraud detection algorithm using Orange tool  
 
          Introduction to Orange Tool  
 
Orange is an open -source data visualization and analysis tool designed for both novice and expert users. It provides 
a user -friendly graphical interface for data mining and machine learning, allowing users to create workflows by 
connecting various data pro cessing and modeling components. Orange's flexibility makes it suitable for tasks such 
as data visualization, classification, clustering, and regression, and it supports various machine learning 
algorithms, including Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and more.  
 
Orange is particularly beneficial for educational purposes, enabling students and researchers to explore machine 
learning concepts without extensive coding knowledge. Its visual programming approach simplifies the 
experimentation process, allowing users to  focus on the analysis and results.  
 
Step -by-Step Procedure to Upload Credit Card Fraud CSV and Apply Random Forest Algorithm in 
Orange  
Step 1: Install Orange  
Download and Install:  
• Go to the Orange website and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or 
Linux).  
• Follow the installation instructions to set up Orange on your computer.  
Step 2: Launch Orange  
Open Orange:  
• Start the Orange application after installation.  
Step 3: Upload the Credit Card Fraud CSV File  
Add the File Widget:  
• In the Orange canvas, locate the “File” widget in the left sidebar under the “Data” category.  
• Drag and drop the File widget onto the canvas.  
Load the CSV File:  
• Double -click the File widget to open its settings.  
• Click on "Browse" and navigate to the location of your Credit Card Fraud CSV file.  
• Select the CSV file and click Open.  
• Click OK to load the dataset.  
Step 4: Data Preprocessing (Optional)  
Check Data Quality:  
• You can use the Data Table widget to visualize the loaded dataset.  
• Add a Data Table widget to the canvas and connect it to the File widget.  
• Double -click the Data Table widget to view the data and check for missing values or inconsistencies.  
Preprocess Data:  
• If necessary, you can use the Select Columns, Edit Domain, or Impute widgets to preprocess your data, 
such as selecting relevant features or handling missing values.  37 
 Step 5: Apply Random Forest Algorithm  
Add the Random Forest Widget:  
• From the left sidebar, locate the "Random Forest" widget under the “Model” category.  
• Drag and drop the Random Forest widget onto the canvas.  
Connect the Widgets:  
• Connect the Data Table (or the File widget if you didn’t use a Data Table) to the Random Forest widget.  
Set Target Variable:  
• Double -click the Random Forest widget to open its settings.  
• Select the target variable (e.g., "fraud" or "is_fraud") from your dataset to train the model on.  
Step 6: Evaluate the Model with Confusion Matrix  
Add a Test & Score Widget:  
• Locate the "Test & Score" widget in the left sidebar under the “Evaluate” category.  
• Drag and drop the Test & Score widget onto the canvas.  
Connect Widgets:  
• Connect the Random Forest widget to the Test & Score widget.  
Configure Test & Score:  
• Double -click the Test & Score widget to open its settings.  
• Ensure that the Random Forest is selected as the model for evaluation.  
• Select an evaluation method, such as Cross Validation or Train/Test Split.  
Add a Confusion Matrix Widget:  
• From the Evaluate category, find the Confusion Matrix widget and drag it onto the canvas.  
• Connect the Test & Score widget to the Confusion Matrix widget.  
Step 7: Run the Workflow  
Execute the Workflow:  
• Click the Run button (the small play icon) in the top right corner of the Orange interface to execute the 
workflow.  
View Results:  
• After execution, you can click on the Test & Score widget to see the evaluation metrics (accuracy, 
precision, recall, etc.).  
• Double -click the Confusion Matrix widget to view the confusion matrix, which shows the model's 
predictions compared to the actual labels.
